\title{Get Common Compounds Between Two Systems}
\usage{
get_common_compounds(dataset1, dataset2, by = "inchi.std")
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset1}{First dataset (from load_report_data).}

\item{dataset2}{Second dataset (from load_report_data).}

\item{by}{Column name to match compounds. Default "inchi.std".}
}
\value{
A 2-column matrix with retention times \link{rt1, rt2} for compounds
present in both systems. If multiple measurements exist for the same
compound, the median RT is used.
}
\description{
Finds compounds that exist in both chromatographic systems and returns
their retention times as a matrix suitable for model building.
