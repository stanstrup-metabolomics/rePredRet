\usage{
build_all_models_furrr(
  report_data,
  min_compounds = 10,
  method = c("fast_ci", "bootstrap"),
  alpha = 0.05,
  n_workers = parallel::detectCores(),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{report_data}{Report data from load_report_data()}

\item{min_compounds}{Minimum overlapping compounds for a pair (default 10)}

\item{method}{"fast_ci" (default, fast) or "bootstrap" (slow, accurate)}

\item{alpha}{Significance level (default 0.05 for 95\% intervals)}

\item{n_workers}{Number of parallel workers (default = available cores)}

\item{save_json}{Save model data as JSON (default TRUE, much faster than HTML)}

\item{export_dir}{Directory to save models (required)}

\item{verbose}{Print progress messages (default TRUE)}
}
\value{
List with:
\itemize{
\item models: list of all built models
\item index: data.frame with model metadata
\item stats: summary statistics
}
}
\description{
Builds retention time prediction models using furrr for efficient outer-level
parallelization. Much faster than nested parallelization approach.
}
\details{
This function uses furrr::future_map for outer-level parallelization,
avoiding nested parallelization overhead. Each worker builds models
sequentially.

Expected speedup vs nested parallelization: 3-4x (less overhead)
